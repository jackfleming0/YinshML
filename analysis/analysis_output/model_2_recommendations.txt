=== Hyperparameter Adjustment Recommendations ===
1. High average calibration error (0.59). Consider a calibration-specific loss or more rigorous training of the value head.
2. Low average temperature in main game phase (0.21). Consider a slower temperature annealing schedule.
3. Low win rate with markers. Consider adding a reward for creating lines of 3 or 4 markers to incentivize this win condition.
4. Low average branching factor in placement phase (0.0). Investigate if the model is exploring enough valid moves. Consider increasing the temperature.
5. Long average move time in main game phase (143.6s). Consider optimizing the move selection algorithm or adjusting search depth.
