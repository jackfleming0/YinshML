      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Design and implement SQLite database schema",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the SQLite database schema implementation into specific subtasks covering schema design, index creation, migration system, and utility functions. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database design with multiple tables, constraints, indexing, and migration systems. While SQLite is simpler than other RDBMS, proper schema design with migrations requires careful planning and implementation. The complexity comes from ensuring proper relationships, efficient querying, and future-proofing."

      "taskTitle": "Develop core ExperimentTracker class",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the ExperimentTracker class implementation into logical subtasks covering core experiment management, metadata capture, asynchronous logging, data retrieval methods, and singleton pattern implementation. For each subtask, specify interfaces, key methods, and integration points.",
      "reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task as it forms the core of the entire system with multiple responsibilities: experiment creation, metadata capture, metric logging, and data retrieval. The asynchronous logging and singleton pattern add architectural complexity. This class will be used by many other components, requiring a robust design."

      "taskTitle": "Implement CLI interface for experiment management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CLI implementation into subtasks covering command structure design, argument parsing, output formatting, error handling, and configuration management. For each subtask, include specific implementation details and user experience considerations.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive CLI involves multiple commands with different argument structures, validation, error handling, and user-friendly output. The need to follow a specific command structure from Appendix B adds constraints. The CLI must interact correctly with the ExperimentTracker core, adding integration complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop automatic git and environment capture",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the automatic capture functionality into subtasks covering git status extraction, environment variable capture, dependency recording, and dataset fingerprinting. For each subtask, specify data collection methods, storage format, and error handling approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integrating with external systems (git, environment, package managers) and handling potential failures gracefully. The dataset fingerprinting adds complexity for ensuring reproducibility. The requirement for lightweight operation means performance considerations are important."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the TensorBoard integration into subtasks covering logger implementation, custom visualization development, experiment comparison views, and background logging. For each subtask, include integration points with TensorBoard API and performance considerations.",
      "reasoning": "TensorBoard integration requires understanding its API and event file format. Creating custom visualizations and comparison views adds complexity. The background logging requirement introduces concurrency considerations to minimize performance impact on the training process."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the dashboard development into subtasks covering backend API design, frontend UI implementation, real-time updates, custom visualizations, and authentication. For each subtask, specify technologies, interfaces, and mobile responsiveness approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks, involving full-stack web development with real-time updates via websockets, responsive design, custom visualizations, and authentication. The requirement for offline functionality and background service adds significant complexity."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the comparison and analysis tools into subtasks covering side-by-side comparison implementation, statistical testing, hyperparameter importance analysis, visualization utilities, and report generation. For each subtask, specify algorithms, statistical methods, and performance optimizations.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing statistical analysis and basic machine learning techniques for hyperparameter importance, which adds significant complexity. Creating visualizations and report generation in multiple formats further increases the scope. The performance requirement (<10 seconds) adds optimization challenges."

    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop experiment reproducibility engine",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the reproducibility engine into subtasks covering environment recreation, configuration restoration, checkpoint management, validation framework, and conflict resolution. For each subtask, include detailed implementation approaches and error handling strategies.",
      "reasoning": "Ensuring exact reproducibility of ML experiments is highly complex, involving environment recreation, configuration management, and random seed control. The automatic detection and resolution of environment conflicts is particularly challenging. Validation that reproduced results match originals adds verification complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration task into subtasks covering ExperimentRunner modifications, TrainingSupervisor updates, configuration system integration, and historical data migration. For each subtask, specify interface changes, backward compatibility approaches, and testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating with existing components requires understanding their current implementation and ensuring backward compatibility. The migration tool for historical data adds complexity. Ensuring graceful degradation if the tracking system is unavailable requires careful error handling and fallback mechanisms."

For each subtask, specify testing methodologies, performance targets, and documentation standards.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive testing across all components with performance optimization is inherently complex. The performance target of <5% overhead requires careful measurement and optimization. Stress testing with large numbers of experiments and implementing efficient data management adds significant complexity."
